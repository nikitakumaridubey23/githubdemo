  The Himalayas abut or cross five countries: Nepal, China, Pakistan, Bhutan and
  India. The sovereignty of the range in the Kashmir region is disputed among
  India, Pakistan, and China.[4] The Himalayan range is bordered on the
  northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by the Tibetan
  Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of the world's
  major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges, and the TsangpoBrahmaputra, rise in the
  vicinity of the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to some
  600 million people; 53 million people live in the Himalayas.[5] The Himalayas
  have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet. Many Himalayan
  peaks are sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. The summits of
  several—Kangchenjunga (from the Indian side), Gangkhar Puensum, Machapuchare,
  Nanda Devi, and Kailash in the Tibetan Transhimalaya—are off-limits to
  climbers.
