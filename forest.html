    A forest is an area of land dominated by trees.[1] Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal 
    standing, and ecological function.[2][3][4] The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters 
    and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use."[5] Using this 
    definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7 million square miles), 
    or approx 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020.

    Forest is very thin and it's just looking like wow.

    <p4> Major findings in forest cover of India</p4>
    <p1> The total forest and tree cover of the country is 80.9 million hectare which is 24.62 percent of the geographical area of the country.
        As compared to the assessment of 2019, there is an increase of 2240 sq km in the total forest and tree cover of the country.
        Out of this, the increase in the forest cover has been observed as 1,540 sq km and that in tree cover is 721 sq km.</p1>
